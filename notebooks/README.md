  <li>  extending_MNIST: As a starting point, consider the well-known MNIST or EMNIST datasets. Obviously, it will allow us to detect common variable names, but it lacks symbols such as the operators. Here I investigate if it's possible to take the existing datasets and use them to augment a small quantity of self-produced data for the symbols. In other words, can large amounts of data of a certain class help generate data for similar classes?</li>
